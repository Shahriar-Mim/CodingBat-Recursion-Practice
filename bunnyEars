QUESTION: 
We have a number of bunnies and each bunny has two big floppy ears. We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies recursively (without loops or multiplication).

bunnyEars(0) → 0
bunnyEars(1) → 2
bunnyEars(2) → 4

SOLUTION: 

public int bunnyEars(int bunnies) {
  if(bunnies > 1){
        int r = 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1);
        return r ; 
      }
      if(bunnies == 1 ){
        return 2 ; 
      } 
      
      return 0 ; 
}
